=== Type Aliases

When you have a type that needs a better name than it's signature, you can (and
should use it's type alias).

[source,scala]
----
// This stands for psuedo random number generator.
// This will name a function signature of `() => Int` to PRNG.
// Only do this if the consumer of your code will find this more intuitive
// than the signature `() => Int`.
type PRNG = () => Int

// Perhaps a more compelling case for a type alias might be:
type SocketGenerator = java.net.SocketAddress => java.net.Socket

// You might use this like so:
def createSocket: SocketGenerator = (new Socket()).connect(_)
