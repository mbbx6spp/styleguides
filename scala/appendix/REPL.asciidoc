=== Scala REPL

The first thing you must learn about Scala is that it has a REPL. This allows
you to play around with code interactively. Not only will this help you learn
Scala the language, but as you discover new libraries and APIs it will allow
you to understand how to use them better and more quickly with faster feedback.

Assuming you have Scala installed and in your `PATH`, you should be able to
type `scala` into your shell. When you do, you should see something like this:
