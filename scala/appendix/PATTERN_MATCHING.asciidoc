=== Pattern Matching

Scala has a builtin mechanism that allows us to on any sort of data
construction in an ordered, first-match fashion. This is called
pattern matching. What do I mean by this? We've already seen one
example of this above so let's look at more examples:

[source,scala]
----
include::holidays.scala[]
----

See link:holidays.scala[] for source.

There were two examples above of pattern matching. One based on case value
constructors and the other based on type discrimination of the value in an
overly general case.

A more simplistic example based on raw values that resembles switch/case
statements in other languages is also possible like so:

[source,scala]
----
include::dayofweek.scala[]
----

See link:dayofweek.scala[] for source.

Above we convert from an `Int` value to a case object that we can use in our
program logic.
