# bash

## Overview

Bash is a ubiquitous shell scripting language that I may or may not replace
with a more suitable candidate in light of the Shellshock vulnerabilities.

However, it is ubiquitous on Linux and widely supported on other UNIX-like
operating systems. So it is hard to "replace". :)

## Influences

Influences of this style guide for Bash are numerous, but a large part of it
is simply having written Bash shell scripts for years without realizing it's
basic constructs until recently when I dived in and actually read the
documentation and spent time to improve my own skills, the hard way.

### Ode To Ben

However, a coworker (Ben Smith) has influenced me to make Bash scripts as
elegant, less error prone, and enjoyable to write as possible. For this I
thank you, although the SREs that request my reviews on their Bash scripts
probably do not thank you. I think I wrote an essay again on a simple 100
line bash script review citing the reasons to prefer one style over another.
And this is the whole reason I bothered to create this repository.

Thank you! (: (Note: the left handed smiley, just for you.)

## Background Material

Here is a list of sources for Bash scripting that I am basing my style
guide on:

* [The Bash Guide](http://guide.bash.academy/)
* [Bash FAQ](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/)
* [Bash Pitfalls](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls)

The above provides good material to get started and also for reference later
on as you write better and better Bash scripts.

## Appropriateness

Here I will shed light on when I think it is appropriate to use Bash for
a task instead of the plethora of other shell, scripting, or compiled
langauges available to us every day.

Appropriate uses for a Bash script are:

* Gluing together various shell commands and handling errors appropriately
* Anything that should not require any special runtimes, interpreters or
  langauges installed on the target run hosts.
* Any script that does not require using a data structure more complex than
  an array. (Yes, Bash 4 has support for associative arrays now, but most
  of our target systems are still Bash 3.)
* Anything you would have done manually on the command line twice should be
  put in a script in some repo. Otherwise please get back to administering
  a Solaris box at your local university.

## Conventions

### Usage
* All scripts must take a -h argument and return the usage. The usage should
  be in BNF or EBNF:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form
* The usage must include every option and argument the script will accept.
* The script must include usable examples below the EBNF. This is really
  helpful when testing code reviews too.
* The script should use lower case for most arguments, unless the option
  'negates' in which case it should be upper case.
* Adding a `-f` option to bypass error checking can really help you in a bind.
* The script should never take any irreversible actions without prompting or
  having `-f` passed.
* Adding a `-d` that does `set -x` is also awesome.

### Variables
* All variables in functions must be locally scoped.
* All variables anywhere should be declared.
* Globally exported variables must be in all uppercase.
* Globally exported variables should be prefixed with an indicator that it
  was created by in house code. i.e. for company Widgets, `W_VAR_NAME` would
  be most excellent
* Variable names should use _ as a word separator
* Locally scoped variables should be in lower case
* Variable names should be meaningful, short names are nobody's friend

### Functions
* All locally created functions should be prefixed with an indicator that
  it was created by in house code, similar to variable naming
* Function names should be in lower case and use _ as a word separator

### Errors

* All error messages should go to `STDERR`.
* All scripts should `set -e` to exit on error.
* All scripts should `set -u` to help prevent unbound variables.
* Doing trap catching to extend debugging output in the event of an error
  will in fact get you laid. This example shows how you would do that
  in a sourced library script:

      function j_its_a_trap() {
        local script_name="$0"
        local trap_name="$1"
        local last_line="$2"
        local last_error="${4:-1}"
        if [ -z "${J_DISABLE_ERR_TRAP:-}" ]; then
          echo "J-ERROR: ${trap_name} ${script_name}: line ${last_line}: return code: ${last_error}" >&2
          echo "J-ERROR: [line: $( caller )] $*" >&2
        fi
      }
      
      function j_enable_traps() {
        local force="${1:-}"
        unset J_DISABLE_ERR_TRAP
        if ! tty >/dev/null 2>&1 || [ -n "$force" ]; then
          trap 'j_its_a_trap "SIGERR" ${LINENO} ${$?}' ERR
          trap 'j_its_a_trap "SIGINT" ${LINENO} ${$?}' INT
          trap 'j_its_a_trap "SIGHUP" ${LINENO} ${$?}' HUP
          trap 'j_its_a_trap "SIGTERM "${LINENO} ${$?}' TERM
          trap 'j_its_a_trap "SIGKILL" ${LINENO} ${$?}' KILL
          trap 'j_its_a_trap "SIGQUIT" ${LINENO} ${$?}' QUIT
        else
          trap 'j_kill_waiting "SIGINT" ${LINENO} ${$?}' INT
        fi
      }
      
      j_enable_traps
* All scripts encountering an unhandlable error *must* report a non-zero exit
  code. The exit code should conform to common conventions outlined below.

      | Exit Code | Reason |
      |-----------|--------|
      | 0         | Ok, successful run of script. |
      | 1         | Catchall for general errors.  |
      | 2         | Missing command, keyword, or permission problem. |
      | 126       | Command invoked cannot execute. |
      | 127       | Command not found. |
      | 128       | Invalid argument to exit. |
      | 128+N     | Fatal error signal received where N is signal sent process.|

  For example, 130 corresponds to a Ctl+C-ed process since signal of 2 is sent
  to the process which typically terminates it.

### Security

* When storing sensitive information in a file location (temporary or
  permanent) ensure you set umask for permissions before creating the
  file where this sensitive data will be stored. You do this like so:
  `umask 0177`.
* When using temporary files, you *must* use the `mktemp` command which will
  create a new file with the specified template. It makes sure that no file
  or symbolic link already exists at that path. You would use this like so:
  `declare tmp_filename="$(mktemp /tmp/appname.secret.XXXX)"`
* The `mktemp` prefix should indicate which script created the file
* There should be a user specific TMP directory defined, most likely as
  `$W_TMP`. All mktemp operations should happen in here instead of just `/tmp`
* If the script creates a lot of temporary files they should be placed in
  an appropriately secured directory specific to the application. It should
  use something similar to `my_tmp_dir=$(mktemp $W_TMP/appname.XXXXX)` to do
  this.
* You *must* never use `eval` or I will slap you with a wet tuna until you
  beg for forgiveness.
* SUID and SGID *must* never be used on shell scripts.

### Naming

#### Files

* Executables should have no extension (preferred) or a .sh extension.
* Libraries *must* have a .sh, .env, .functions extension and *should* not be
  executable.
* Script names should be easily readable and convey useful information about
  the functionality of the script.
  i.e. j-git-migrate-branches, j-config-deploy

### Structure

#### Indentation

* Use 2 soft spaces. No tabs.
* All continued lines should be indented further than the line it extends

#### Line Length

* All lines should be 80 characters or less, use `\` to extend lines (and
  indent!)

#### Comments

* Each file should start with a comment block that describes its contents,
  its purpose, its requirements/expectations, and its limitations. Only a
  shebang is permitted above a header comment block in an executable script
  due to necessity.
* Each function which is non-trivial in functionality should have a comment
  header that describes the inputs, outputs and side effects of the function.
* Keep track of what you plan on improving using TODO comments.
* Explain tricky lines of the script inline immediately above the offending
  line and explain why it is 'tricky'. (Note: tricky is never good, but
  sometimes necessary.)

#### Style

* Always use `$(command)` instead of backticks.
  [Here are the reasons why](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082)
* You *must* put `; do` and `; then` on the same line as the `while`, `for`
  or `if`.
