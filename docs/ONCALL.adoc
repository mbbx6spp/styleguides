== Dates Oncall:

=== Summary/Notes:

* Use this section to put high level context that may be helpful to the next person on-call

Example:

* There was a deploy of a significant number of changes to `service` on `date`. This has triggered
  a number of escalations which have exposed a lack of monitoring visibility into one of the systems
  that `service` depends on. This ticket `T-1234` tracks investigating more metrics and this ticket
  `T-4321` covers investigation into how the `service` could be made more robust in the future.

=== Continuing Incidents

* Put issues that weren't fully resolved here, include a link and a risk summary

=== Incidents

* Each incident/ticket that is worked on by the on-call should go in this section. This should include
  a high level summary of the issue, what corrective action (if any) was taken, and a link for further details.
