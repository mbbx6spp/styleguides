The goal of this document is to provide a list of items required when
working on scoping a project. It uses the same steps laid out in the
link:EXPERIMENT.asciidoc[experiment] doc but the wording is aimed at improving project scoping
and success criteria.

== Title:

=== Project Description

* What benefit is this project hoping to provide?
* What evidence supports why there may be a problem and why we need to
  solve it?
* What business impact does this have?

=== Suggested Improvement (Project Plan)

* State a possible solution for the problem at hand.
* Identify success criteria
* Refer to documentation that supports this method

=== Definitions:

* Define terms that will be used in this document for better clarity.

=== Assumptions:

* List all simplifying assumptions for the sake of making the experiment
  feasible.

=== Tools:

* List all tools used for investigation.
* Provide advantages and disadvantages of each tool w.r.t. measurement precision,
  accuracy, and any caveats.

=== Work Required:

* What work is required to implement this? Detail a plan of action and how
  you arrived at these steps (supporting evidence)
* What is the resource requirement for these steps?
* Describe pros and cons of the procedure described and given the constraints
  (time, material, money, etc.) on the investigation.

=== Results (Data):

* Report on success criteria
* Show how this was collected so that it can be collected again in the future

=== Limitations:

* Discuss possible errors that could have occurred in the collection of the
  data (experimental errors)
* Describe any limitations of the procedure, tools, and what the raw data
  can tell us. How does that limit the scope of the conclusions?

=== Conclusions:

* State clearly if the results validate or invalidate your original hypothesis.
* Explain using the data, both raw and derived measures from the raw data, why
  that conclusion was arrived at.
* Display any derived measurements from the raw data that assist in explaining
  the determination of accepting or rejecting the hypothesis.
* Evaluate any areas where improvements could be made. Identify key areas where
  things either didn't go as expected. This is not meant as a place for finding
  fault but is meant as a way to improve the team and the organization.
* A project can fail and still be a success for the business, but only if the
  items that caused it to fail are identified and future work is scheduled to
  improve/rectify them.

=== Future Work:

* What actions will be taken based on this experiment with a timeline plus who
  has responsibility of following through on these actions.
