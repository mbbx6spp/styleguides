== Title:

=== Problem Statement:

* What question(s) are you trying to answer? Limit the scope where possible.
* Include background information, observations, and evidence surrounding the
  problem space.

=== Definitions:

* Define terms that will be used in this document for better clarity.

=== Hypothesis:

* State a possible solution for the problem at hand.
* Describe what criteria supports or nullifies your hypothesis.

=== Assumptions:

* List all simplifying assumptions for the sake of making the experiment
  feasible.

=== Theory:

* Outline, reference, and/or describe any theory or background knowledge
  needed to conduct the experiment and/or analyze results in a meaningful way.

=== Related Work

* Reference related works to this experiment and explain how and why this
  experiment is still useful given these works/projects/experiments are
  already in progress or completed.

=== Tools:

* List all tools used for investigation.
* Provide advantages and disadvantages of each tool w.r.t. measurement precision,
  accuracy, and any caveats.

=== Procedure:

* Write a numbered list of steps or (better) provide a well commented script
  that describes or runs the process used to extract data used to validate or
  invalidate the hypothesis.
* Ensure this is reproducible and all dependencies are documented or scripted.
* Describe pros and cons of the procedure described and given the constraints
  (time, material, money, etc.) on the investigation.

=== Results (Data):

* This section includes data tables, graphs, or other visualizations of the raw
  data to show what was measured as part of the experiment/investigation.

=== Limitations:

* Discuss possible errors that could have occurred in the collection of the
  data (experimental errors)
* Describe any limitations of the procedure, tools, and what the raw data
  can tell us. How does that limit the scope of the conclusions?

=== Conclusions:

* State clearly if the results validate or invalidate your original hypothesis.
* Explain using the data, both raw and derived measures from the raw data, why
  that conclusion was arrived at.
* Display any derived measurements from the raw data that assist in explaining
  the determination of accepting or rejecting the hypothesis.

=== Future Work:

* What actions will be taken based on this experiment with a timeline plus who
  has responsibility of following through on these actions.
