## Requirements for ${PROJECT_NAME}

### Stakeholders &amp; Actors

In this section you should:

* identify the stakeholders for the success of the project (this is not
  necessarily the same as the actors that interact with the solution)
* identify the actors of the system to be developed, deployed, and/or
  provisioned.
* for each actor describe who or what they are plus how and why they interact
  with the system briefly.
* also describe expected SLAs for each actor

### Assumptions

List any assumptions you make when listing the requirements and/or identifying
stakeholders and/or actors.

### Requirements: Mandatory

In this section you should provide a list of requirements the chosen solution
must satisfy. Make this as minimum and simple as possible to ensure business
success.

Each requirement should contain a brief but tangible business rationale for
being mandatory. For example, when choosing a secret store we might make it
mandatory to expect the secret store to do auto expiration of tokens/keys
that are generated via its APIs to avoid every application writing custom
logic to expire the tokens/keys themselves which introduces a much higher
likelihood of bugs and/or lack of consistency in how these tokens/keys are
handled across the organization. From an Info Sec perspective this would be
highly undesirable and may impact the security of the company's customers and
protecting customer trust is critical to business success.

### Requirements: Optional

Describe any optional features that would be desirable in the solution.

A brief business justification on why these may be desirable from a
stakeholder and/or user's perspective should be provided.

### Next Steps

List any implications or actionable items that need to be addressed related to
this project to move forward.

Now get all stakeholders to agree on the requirements. :)
